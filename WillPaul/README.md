# Proposal: Paper exploring content and meta-data ownership in the cloud-computing age

- Will Paul (whp3652)

As the web has web has evolved over the last several decades there has been a fundamental shift away from local ownership towards cloud-based subscription services. We no longer purchase or download, only consume. In this new environment all our media libraries are basically identical and it is only what you do with them, your meta-data, which sets it apart.

On the surface this seems like a positive for most parties involved. However, when a company goes under (e.g. Grooveshark) or you switch providers, what happens to that meta-data? What emerges is a proprietary system that promotes vendor lock-in and in the case of Grooveshark instant, massive data loss.

Currently I am working on an open source platform for syncing playlist data from local and cloud platforms and I want to use this paper as an opportunity to dig into the motivation for such a project specifically and more open approaches to cloud-computing in general.
